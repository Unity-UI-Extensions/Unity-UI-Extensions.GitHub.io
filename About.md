## What is this repository for?

In this repository is a collection of extension scripts / effects and controls to enhance your Unity UI experience. These scripts have been gathered from many sources and combined and improved over time.
New controls and effects are added constantly in source and packaged on a release cycle for easier install.

> The majority of the scripts came from the Scripts thread on the [Unity UI forum here](http://bit.ly/UnityUIScriptsForumPost)

You can either download / fork this project to access the scripts, or you can also download these pre-compiled Unity Assets, chock full of goodness for each release:

## [Download](/Downloads.md)

The asset has been fully tested on all current versions of Unity (for versions prior to Unity 5.3, please see the [archive](/Downloads.md))
