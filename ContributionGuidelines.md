# Contribution guidelines

Got a script you want added? Then just fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Unity-UI-Extensions/com.unity.uiextensions.git) and submit a PR.  All contributions accepted (including fixes)

Just ensure:

* The header of the script matches the standard used in all scripts
* The script uses the **Unity.UI.Extensions** namespace so they do not affect any other developments
* Ensure there are no unnecessary "usings" declarations in the script to avoid warning notices
* Try where possible to annotate your code, so it's clear what each part does (also add TOOLTIPS to any public parameters)
* (optional) Add Component and Editor options where possible (editor options are in the Editor\UIExtensionsMenuOptions.cs file)
