# Contributors

A huge thanks to all of the contributors and supports of the project, without you, this would be a much harder job.

Time as we know is the root of all evil, so without the communities support, it's hard to dedicate enough effort to constantly maintain the project.  The 2.0 release alone has consumed over 3 months of my time away from my other projects (and my own games) that I'm invested in.

Your support goes a long way to helping keep the project alive. (and may open the doors to other rewards in the future)

The code contributors go without saying, their names are listed everywhere and on every script in the project, please support them and help them become gaming legends wherever you see their names come up.

As for the unsung heroes who have also contributed funds to the project, they are:

* **Streamfall Interactive** (our biggest supporter to date!)
* Plastic Cow Games
* Marcus Wallinder
* Rodrigo Laiz
* Tri Nguyen
* Sourabh Verma
* Jakov Dužević
* **Scott Looney** (our first supporter!)

With the new support / contribution options I hope to see this list increase and I'll be able to also start offering other rewards back to everyone supporting the project (likely beginning with 3D printed gifts of your choice :D)
