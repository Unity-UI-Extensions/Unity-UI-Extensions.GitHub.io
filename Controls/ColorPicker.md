# Color Picker

==============

A generated control using the new [Box Slider](https://bitbucket.org/UnityUIExtensions/unity-ui-extensions/wiki/Controls/BoxSlider) control and several sliders with helpers.

Creates a Color Picker style control to generate color values within a Unity Project. Handles color sampling with a cursor as well as saving/loading presets.

### Color Picker control

Uses the renderer material to expose the selected color from the combined control.

Like the other Unity UI controls, it includes an OnValueChanged event which outputs the Color of the control as it's changed.

### Color Sampler

Captures the screen when it is enabled, then provides a cursor with which the user can select colors from the screen.

### Color Picker Presets

Manages saving/loading presets to a JSON file or player prefs.

*Sampler Outline* (outline) |The outline of the cursor to make it easier to see what's being sampled.
*On Color Selected* (event) |Callback for when the cursor is clicked on a color. This should connect to the ColorPickerControl.CurrentColor at minimum.

### Color Sampler properties

The properties of the Box Slider control are as follows:

Property | Description

*On Value Changed* (event) |The Event fired when the color within the picker is changed

*RGB Sliders* (GameObject array) |Contains references to the components that are part of the RGB sliders display.
*Alpha Slider* (GameObject) |The alphas slider (turns off if both RGB and HSV sliders are off).

### Color Picker Presets properties

*Preset Prefab* (GameObject)| UI component for displaying the preset(s).
*Max Presets* (int)| The max number of presets allowed (to control the UI size).

*Save Mode* (enum)| None, JSON, PlayerPrefs - the mode used for saving user-defined presets.

---------

## Usage

Simply add the Color Picker object to a canvas in a scene using the prefab located in "*Assets / unity-ui-extensions / Examples / ColorPicker*". Toggle on/off the HSV or RGB sliders as desired.

Feel free to remove any unnecessary sliders or alter UI to meet your needs. Can also use this as a base to create your own picker, just be sure to use the following add-on components:

* ColorField - used to display the current color of the picker
* ColorSlider - used to bind a slider and it's value to the picker, also sets the range to bind (R,G,B,A,H,S,V)
* HSV Box Slider - used to bind a Box Slider control to the color picker
* Hex Color Field - used to bin an Input Field to a color picker and do Hex Code validation

To access the ColorPicker color direct in code:

```csharp
public Renderer pickerRenderer;
public ColorPickerControl picker;

void Awake()
{
    pickerRenderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
}
// Use this for initialization
void Start()
{
    picker.onValueChanged.AddListener(color =>
    {
        pickerRenderer.material.color = color;
    });
}
```

The ColorPickerPresets and ColorSampler are all set up in the prefab without need for any scripting. However, both can be extended from with relative ease if you need different functionality.
