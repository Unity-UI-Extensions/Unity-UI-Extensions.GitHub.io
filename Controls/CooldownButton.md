## Overview

In several games, a power-up or cooldown logic is required when clicking on a button, this control enables that behaviour in a single reusable script.

This can be attached to any control implementing "Selectable" behaviour, such as:

* Button
* Toggle
* Non-Drawing Graphic

In the example "Cooldown" scene, it also demonstrates how to pair up this control with other effects such as the SoftMask effect and the native Unity image effects.  Showing how to add a fading/growing style effect when clicked.

Lastly, the control also has "extra" click detection allowing further feedback in it's use, so if a user clicks on the control when it is "cooling down", you can optionally apply additional feedback to inform the users that it can't be clicked as it is cooling down.
