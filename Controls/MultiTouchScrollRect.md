## Overview

Unity's ScrollRect is behaving erratic when more than one touch is used for drag. It seems to be a bug with the UI system as it jumps between fingers (to moving one). This script fixes it by blocking event data based on touch id.

---------

## Properties

No additional properties, inherits from the original ScrollRect

---------

## Usage

Simply replace the original ScrollRect with the new MultiTouchScrollRect:
Add Component -> UI -> Extensions -> MultiTouchScrollRect

---------

## Video Demo

None, no change to Scroll Rect
