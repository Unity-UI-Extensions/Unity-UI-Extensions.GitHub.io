## Overview

Similar to the Horizontal and Vertical Layout components provided by Unity, this offers to bend the layout in a radial fashion.

---------

## Properties

Property | Description
-|-
*Start Angle*|Angle where the first child is positioned.
*Sweep Angle*|Total angle covered by all children.
*Radius*|Distance from the center to each child.
*Min Angle Between Items*|Optional minimum spacing enforced between children.
*Clockwise*|Place children clockwise when enabled; counterclockwise when disabled.
*Control Child Size*|Force children to size to the layout slot.

---------

## Methods

This component does not expose public methods beyond inherited behaviour.

---------

## Usage

Like with other Layout controls, simply add this to the parent RectTransform for a collection of child elements through the Add Component menu as follows:

"*Add Component -> Layout -> Extensions -> Radial Layout*"
