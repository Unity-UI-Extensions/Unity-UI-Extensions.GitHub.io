## Overview

Similar to the Horizontal and Vertical Layout components provided by Unity, this offers to bend the layout in a radial fashion.

Like with other Layout controls, simply add this to the parent RectTransform for a collection of child elements through the Add Component menu as follows:
Add Component -> Layout -> Extensions -> Radial Layout
