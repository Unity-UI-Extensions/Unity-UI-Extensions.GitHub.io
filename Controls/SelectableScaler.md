The properties of the Selectable Scalar control are as follows:

*Speed*|The speed at which the animation will take effect.

## Usage

Like with other Layout controls, simply add this control to any control that has a *Selectable* component (e.g. Button, NonGraphicSelectable) through the Add Component menu as follows:
