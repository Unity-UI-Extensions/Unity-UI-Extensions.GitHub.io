# Stepper

A stepper control, like those found in iOS. It's basically two buttons side by side, and can step its numeric value up and down.

## Overview

The Stepper Control creates an increment / decrement style control with + and - buttons which alter the controls value.

It exposes a value property where you can also set a min and maximum number for that value when changed through the control.  Additionally you can also specify the "step" which denotes how much the control increments / decrements with each press, as well as an option to loop the value around from top to bottom, etc.

Like the [Segmented Control](/Controls/SegmentedControl.md), you can also specify a Separator image attached to a GO to place between the buttons.

> *NOTE* You can only have two child buttons attached to the Stepper, one each for the + and - actions.  Adding more will generate an error.

## Properties

The properties of the Stepper Control control are as follows:

Property | Description
|-|-|
*Value*|The current value of the Stepper control
*Minimum*|The minimum value for the Stepper
*Maximum*|The maximum value for the Stepper
*Step*|The number to increment / decrement the control with when the buttons are clicked
*Wrap*|Does the value of the stepper wrap around when the max/min is reached
*Separator*|A graphic based UI GO, which will serve as the image that separates each button. *Note, you should disable the GO used for the separator or use a prefab to avoid dirtying the scene.
*On Value Changed* (event) |The Event fired when the handle within the value of the control is changed

---------

## Usage

Simply add the default Stepper to the scene using "*UI / Extensions / Stepper*" in the Editor "*GameObject*" menu.

It is also available as a Game Component menu in "*UI / Extensions / Stepper*". However, you will need to manually add the two child selectable controls (e.g. A UI Button or other control implementing the "Selectable" interface).
