## Overview

The Flippable effect allows you to flip a graphic either on the Horizontal axis, vertical axis or both through this simple component..

*Note* when used with other graphical effects, this component must be ordered the highest, else Unity will report an error. (see usage)

---------

## Properties

The properties of the UI Flippable component are as follows:

Property | Description
|-|-|
*Horizontal*|Flip the graphic horizontally
*Vertical*|Flip the graphic vertically

---------

## Usage

Available as a Game Component menu in "*UI / Effects / Extensions / Flippable*". Simple add to any Image or Graphic Component.

> *Note*
> Unity has changed it's behaviour about stacking multiple BaseMeshEffects, if the effect alters vertices then the component must be ordered at the top of the components.  
> E.G. UIFlippable must be ordered above OutLine / NicerOutline etc.
> The control will automatically do this when added to a GameObject, but if you reorder it you may get a NullReferenceException.  To fix, either reorder or touch any property.
