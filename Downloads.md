# Unity UI Extensions Asset downloads

Below is a list of all the `.UnityPackage` asset package downloads for the Unity UI Extensions project

## Update 2019.6 - (v2.5)  - Bug Squash

We have expanded where you can download the UnityPackage asset and widened the options to contribute to the project. **Check the [Release notes](./ReleaseNotes/RELEASENOTES.md) for Upgrade information**

> I will still stress however, ***contribution is optional***. **The assets / code will always remain FREE**

### Release 1.1

Below is a list of all the previous asset package downloads for the Unity UI Extensions project (once Unity approve it. I'll list the asset store link here as well)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 4.x Asset](https://bitbucket.org/ddreaper/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-4.x.unitypackage)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.1 Asset](https://bitbucket.org/ddreaper/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.1.unitypackage)

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.2 Asset](https://bitbucket.org/ddreaper/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.2.unitypackage) <- 5.2.0 - 5.2.1 base releases ONLY

* [Unity UI Extensions Unity 5.3 (5.2.1P+) Asset](https://bitbucket.org/ddreaper/unity-ui-extensions/downloads/UnityUIExtensions-5.3.unitypackage) <- use this for 5.2.1P+ releases

> **Note** To retain 5.2 compatibility in the 5.3 package, you will see two warnings related to:
>
> ```csharp
> `UnityEngine.UI.InputField.onValueChange' is obsolete.  
> ```
>
> This has no effect on the package working in 5.4 plus and is only there to maintain backwards compatibility.  We will look to update/remove this in a future release, likely after 5.4.  If you have any concerns, feel free to update your code in your project to add the missing "d".  Unity have ensured it still works as they have mapped the API change for now.

## Other downloads on the Bitbucket site

As this repo was created to support my new Unity UI Title ["Unity 3D UI Essentials"](http://bit.ly/Unity3DUIEssentials), in the downloads section you will find two custom assets (SpaceShip-DemoScene-Start.unitypackage and RollABallSample-Start.unitypackage).  

These are just here as starter scenes for doing UI tasks in the book.
