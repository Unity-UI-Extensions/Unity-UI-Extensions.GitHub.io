## Installation Instructions

As of Unity 2019, there are now two paths for getting access to the Unity UI Extensions project:

- [Unity 2019 or higher](/UPMInstallation.md)
The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the [Unity Package Manager](/UPMInstallation.md) to reference the project and install it.

Alternatively, you can also use the [pre-compiled Unity packages](/Downloads.md) if you wish, however, UPM offers full versioning support to allow you to switch versions as you wish.

- [Unity 2018 or lower](/Downloads.md)
The [pre-compiled Unity assets](/Downloads.md) are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.
