## Release 2019.5 - (v2.2.7)  - Accelerated Deployment <- current release>

> New 2.3 release coming very soon for 2023...

We have expanded where you can download the UnityPackage asset and widened the options to contribute to the project.

[Unity 2019 or higher](UPMInstallation.md)
The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the [Unity Package Manager](UPMInstallation) to reference the project and install it.

> I will still stress however, ***contribution is optional***. **The assets / code will always remain FREE**

## [Installation Instructions](UPMInstallation.md)

New for 2020, we have added OpenUPM support and the package can be installed using the following [OpenUPM CLI](https://openupm.com/docs/) command:

```cli
`openupm add com.unity.uiextensions`
```
> For more details on using [OpenUPM CLI, check the docs here](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli#installation).

As of Unity 2019, there are now two paths for getting access to the Unity UI Extensions project:

- [Unity 2019 or higher](UPMInstallation.md)
The recommended way to add the Unity UI Extensions project to your solution is to use the Unity package Manager. Simply use the [Unity Package Manager](UPMInstallation) to reference the project and install it.

Alternatively, you can also use the [pre-compiled Unity packages](Downloads.md) if you wish, however, UPM offers full versioning support to allow you to switch versions as you wish.

- [Unity 2018 or lower](Downloads.md)
The [pre-compiled Unity assets](Downloads.md) are the only solution for Unity 2018 or earlier due to the changes in the Unity UI framework in Unity made for 2019.
Either clone / download this repository to your machine and then copy the scripts in, or use the pre-packaged .UnityPackage for your version of Unity and import it as a custom package in to your project.
