## Summary

`DropDownMenuControl` is a lightweight, anchored drop-down **action menu** — the kind of overflow / context menu that opens from a "⋯" or avatar button. It opens as an overlay anchored to a trigger element and dismisses when the backdrop is tapped. Each option is a large, independently tappable row; choosing one closes the menu and invokes that option's callback.

The menu injects a full-screen transparent backdrop and a floating panel directly into the panel's **root** visual tree, so it is never clipped or constrained by the layout of its anchor. It is purely programmatic — construct it once and drive it with `Open(...)`.

> This is distinct from [`DropDownControl`](DropDownControl.md), which is a *value picker* (wheel-style single-value select). `DropDownMenuControl` is an *action menu*: each row runs a callback rather than selecting a value.

Typical use cases:

- Overflow ("⋯") menus on cards, list rows, or headers
- Right-click / long-press context actions (View, Edit, Remove…)
- Compact action menus anchored to an avatar or icon button

## Nested Types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DropDownOption` | A readonly struct pairing a `string Label` with an `Action OnSelected` callback. Construct with `new DropDownOption("Label", () => { … })`. |
| `Placement` | Enum controlling how the panel is positioned relative to the anchor. |

### `Placement` values

| Value | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `AnchorRight` | Right edge aligned to the anchor's right edge, dropping downward (flips upward on bottom overflow). The default. |
| `CenteredOnAnchor` | Centered on the anchor on both axes, clamped to the screen edges. |

## Properties

| Name | Description | Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IsOpen` | (Read-only) Whether the menu is currently open. | `bool` |

## USS Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dropDownMenuControl__backdrop` | Full-screen transparent backdrop injected behind the panel; tapping it closes the menu. |
| `dropDownMenuControl__panel` | The floating menu panel (fixed width, positioned by the control). |
| `dropDownMenuControl__row` | A single option row. Its USS `height` must stay in sync with the control's `RowHeightPx` (96 px) used for overflow maths. |
| `dropDownMenuControl__row--first` | Modifier applied to the first row (e.g. to drop the top divider / round the top corners). |
| `dropDownMenuControl__rowLabel` | The label inside a row. Picking is ignored so the row receives the tap. |

## Public Methods

| Signature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Open(VisualElement anchor, IReadOnlyList<DropDownOption> options, Placement placement = AnchorRight, Action onDismissed = null)` | Builds the rows and opens the menu anchored to `anchor`. Ignored if `anchor`/`options` are null or empty, or the anchor is not attached to a panel. Re-opening while open closes the previous instance first. |
| `Close()` | Closes the menu, removes the panel and backdrop, and invokes the `onDismissed` callback (unless an option was chosen, which clears it first). |

## Using the Control

### Open an overflow menu from a button

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UIElements;
using UnityUIToolkit.Extensions;

public class CardActionsController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private UIDocument _document;

    private readonly DropDownMenuControl _menu = new DropDownMenuControl();

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        var moreButton = _document.rootVisualElement.Q<Button>("more-button");

        moreButton.clicked += () =>
        {
            _menu.Open(moreButton, new List<DropDownMenuControl.DropDownOption>
            {
                new DropDownMenuControl.DropDownOption("View",   () => Debug.Log("View")),
                new DropDownMenuControl.DropDownOption("Edit",   () => Debug.Log("Edit")),
                new DropDownMenuControl.DropDownOption("Remove", () => Debug.Log("Remove")),
            },
            DropDownMenuControl.Placement.AnchorRight,
            onDismissed: () => Debug.Log("Menu dismissed without a choice"));
        };
    }
}
```
