## Summary

`DropDownControl` is a wheel-style dropdown picker that opens from an inline trigger and lets the user confirm a single value from a vertically scrollable modal list.

Typical use cases:

- Dial-code or country-code selection before a phone field
- Compact selectors that need a touch-friendly modal confirmation step
- Any workflow where a finite string list should feel like a native mobile picker rather than a standard menu

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Items` | `IReadOnlyList<string>` | Ordered values shown in the picker. Updating the list refreshes the trigger label and open list content. |
| `Value` | `string` | The currently selected value, or an empty string when `Items` is empty. |
